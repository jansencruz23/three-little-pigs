                The first little pig was frightened as he escaped and ran away to hide with the second little pig.
            </p>
            <p>
                The wolf continued down the lane and he passed by the second house made of sticks; and he saw the house,
                and he smelled the pigs inside, and his mouth began to water as he thought about the fine dinner they
                would
                make.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section id="Character">
            <p>
                But second little pig worked a little bit harder than the first but he was somewhat lazy too and he
                built
                his house out of sticks.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section id="Confrontation">
            <p>
                So the wold knocked on the door and said:
            </p>
            <p>
                Little pigs! Little pigs!
                Let me in! Let me in!
                But the little pigs saw the wolf's pointy ears through the keyhole, so they answered back:
            </p>
            <p>
                No! No! No!
                Not by the hairs on our chinny chin chin!
                So the wolf showed his teeth and said:
            </p>
            <p>
                Then I'll huff
                and I'll puff
                and I'll blow your house down!
            </p>
        </section>
        <section id="Climax">
            <p>
                So he huffed and he puffed and he blew the house down! The wolf was greedy and he tried to
                catch both pigs at once, but he was too greedy and got neither! His big jaws clamped down on
                nothing but air and the two little pigs scrambled away as fast as their little hooves would carry them.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section id="Conclusion">
            <p>
                The wolf chased them down the lane and he almost caught them.
                But they made it to the brick house and slammed the door closed before the wolf could catch them.
